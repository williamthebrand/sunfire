# first movement

The heat seered across the earths surface, the arora winds were up and constantly whisping bursts of heat around you. The humidity made life miserable for all the inhabitants of the campus. It wrapped around you and managed to smother all hopes of relief from the heat. But, in the midst of this campus wide boiler of a day, lana seemed to float above it all.

It seems like only yesterday I could smell the sweat exreating from every surfae of the southern landscape. I hair was blowing in the aurora winds bellowing upwards towards the sky. The earth was a gigantic frying pan, and we were two people amongst it all together intwined and bound to each other in this tainted world. I had loved someone before, but never before had someone commanded it as much as lana roskovic.
She may have even been fully aware of this, but what started as a dual of two minds, became something more, we found ourselves lost in a moment of collision,  unable to slow down and grab ahold of each other. Just as passengers are thrown out of cars,  we were thrown out into life.  The only choice given to us, was to stare at each other as we passed , and hopefully hold onto the moment. This moment when they fell into each other's eyes.

The heat swelled up from the hot pavement generating a disturbingly natural aurora wind. The wind brushed up against her lose fitting clothing lifting her light blond hair.
She protested , "I believe sweat shops can provide opportunity an opportunity for capitalism to flourish in third World Countries."
"I Know, they Can." I replied.
I could see she was in unusually good form. It must have been because today She Could Wear her favorite pair of Jeans, the Ones She talks about making her butt Look fantastic. 'My ass looks fantastic', she use to say. It wasn't that the jeans did anything miraculous, it was how they made her feel; cute, young, and free like every College girl should feel. It was this boost in confidence that made the biggest difference in her, it gave her the admonishment that She so desired , the admonishment that was somehow missing in her life.
Did you see it when Dr. Asad Walked into the Lecture?" she inquired in an attempt to change Subject noticing my short attention span was wandering off again. This always bothered me , not because of her changing the subject, but because I did not want to do anything to make her feel less than important. Because , in reality she was real important to me.

Lana's ballard on sweat shop ethics was far from over, but she knew that it was going to have to be shortened quickly before she was later for her second job selling childrens clothing at the mall. It was a crummy job, but she said it allowed her to get her homework done and make some reasonable cash at the same job. Her normal job was only the luckiest job on campus, and that was being the personally assigned and funded teaching assisstant for Dr. humboldt, which was a job invented just for her, to help her stay in college. It was a very generous offer from humboldt, whom obviously had pulled some favors to get it arranged for his favorite student.
She drove off in her little put-put of a car, with the usual million dollar smile and a quick flash of the hand as she mouthed bye,bye. I woundered if she looked at everyone so cheerfully. I watched as her little egg shaped care wombled over the hill and disappeared. The best part of my day just came to a close. I would wander about the town for the remainder of the night, empty and lifeless, unconscious of my actions until tomorrow when the sound of her voice will breath warmth into my soul.
....
The smell of fresh ground coffee lusciously fills the air and the constant sounds of steam schrealing out of the expresso machine.
